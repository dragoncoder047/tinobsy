# tinobsy

A tiny object system for C. No included scripting language, but I'm working on one and will share it once Tinobsy is complete.

## features

* Infinitely possible types.
* Lightweight. Each object is only 24 bytes.
* Garbage-collected. Includes both a reference-counting collector (for speed) and a full mark-and-sweep (to prevent memory leaks).
* Includes thread management support. (OS-agnostic, thread spawn/kill support not implemented here.)
* Single-file C header.

## usage
